    <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Academic_career">
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[7] in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a
        family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.[20][21] His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and
        Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded
        Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct
        current.[7]
    </blockquote>

    <p>One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German 
        regime with the phrase, <q>not yet hanged</q>, offering a $5,000 
        bounty on his head.</p>
